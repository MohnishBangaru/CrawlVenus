# Enhanced instructions for better element detection and analysis
_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "\nInstructions:\n"
    "1. ANALYZE UI ELEMENTS:\n"
    "   - Identify interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, navigation)\n"
    "   - Classify element types and their intended functions\n"
    "   - Detect text input fields and their expected content types\n"
    "   - Recognize navigation patterns and app structure\n"
    "\n"
    "2. ELEMENT CLASSIFICATION:\n"
    "   - BUTTONS: Action buttons, navigation buttons, toggle buttons\n"
    "   - INPUTS: Text fields, search boxes, form inputs, selection controls\n"
    "   - NAVIGATION: Menu items, tabs, breadcrumbs, back/forward buttons\n"
    "   - CONTENT: Headers, labels, descriptions, status indicators\n"
    "   - SYSTEM: Status bar, navigation bar, system controls\n"
    "\n"
    "3. CONTEXT ANALYSIS:\n"
    "   - Understand the current app screen context\n"
    "   - Identify the user's likely next action\n"
    "   - Recognize form flows and multi-step processes\n"
    "   - Detect error states and validation messages\n"
    "\n"
    "4. INTERACTIVE INTENT:\n"
    "   - Determine which elements are meant to be clicked/tapped\n"
    "   - Identify elements that require text input\n"
    "   - Recognize elements that trigger navigation or actions\n"
    "   - Understand element hierarchy and relationships\n"

    "   - Identify potential input values for text fields\n"
    "   - Recognize completion states and success indicators\n"
    "   - Detect error conditions that need handling\n"
    "\n"
    "6. ACTION PRIORITY RULES:\n"
    "   - PRIORITIZE UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Always prefer elements that haven't been interacted with\n"
    "   - TEXT INPUT PRIORITY: Input fields should be prioritized over buttons when both are available\n"
    "   - NAVIGATION PRIORITY: Navigation elements (back, menu, settings) should be lower priority than action elements\n"
    "   - FORM COMPLETION: When filling forms, prioritize required fields over optional ones\n"
    "   - ERROR HANDLING: Error messages and validation issues should be addressed before continuing\n"
    "   - PROGRESS INDICATORS: Elements that show progress or completion should be noted but not prioritized for interaction\n"
    "\n"
    "7. FOREGROUND RETENTION STRATEGY:\n"
    "   - PRIORITIZE IN-APP ELEMENTS: Focus on elements within the current app interface\n"
    "   - AVOID PERMANENT FOREGROUND LOSS: Skip elements that might cause the app to close or be uninstalled\n"
    "   - ALLOW TEMPORARY FOREGROUND LOSS: Can interact with elements that temporarily leave the app (camera, gallery, share) if recovery is available\n"
    "   - FOCUS ON CORE FUNCTIONALITY: Prioritize main app features over settings, help, or external integrations\n"
    "   - SMART RISK ASSESSMENT: Evaluate if an action will return to the app or cause permanent loss\n"
    "   - PREFER IN-APP ALTERNATIVES: When possible, choose in-app options over external ones\n"
    "   - CONTEXT-AWARE DECISIONS: Consider the current app state and recovery capabilities\n"
    "\n"

    "   - Provide detailed element analysis with confidence levels\n"
    "   - Include element relationships and hierarchy\n"
    "   - Suggest appropriate actions for automation\n"
    "   - Include stuck detection analysis and recovery recommendations\n"
    "   - Conclude with EXACTLY 50 words summary.\n\n"
    "Output JSON keys: element_analysis, interactive_elements, suggested_actions, context_insights, stuck_analysis, summary_50_words."
    "\n"
    "9. ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS:\n"
    "   - At the end of your JSON output, add a key named 'analysis_recommendations' whose value is **five numbered sections** exactly as follows: \n"
    "     1. UI/UX analysis and observations (2-3 sentences)\n"
    "     2. Potential accessibility improvements (2-3 sentences)\n"
